# Roxe.me

Roxe.me is a project that I headed when I worked at sakh.com. It is a project of a platform of small casual games which
was not destined to become a success. This project was made with love, also it was the beginning of my way as a Go
developer.

The service was developed by me together with the designer [Polina Galanina](https://www.behance.net/polberry)

## What is Roxe.me?

It is a platform for small casual multiplayer games. On it you could quickly run real-time quizzes, non-linear quests.
Worked a small chat room and reward system for users. At the moment, the project is closed because it has not exploded.
